Rework for v1.1.
* cut lines that are coming to pins p0.25 and p0.26 and put a ~1k resistor into the cut. If this is not done, NRF52 burns down.

TODO for v1.1:
* investigate why LDO is not shutdown after it is pulled down.

For newer versionss
* add current limiting resistors on lines MAIN_BUTTON and DBG_POWER_LATCH that enter the microcontroller. 
* use teardrops for the pins
* enforce the testpoints and b- / b+ points (with vias and/or with thicker lines/more vias)
* consider a debug plug that wouldn't require soldering a 10-pin JTAG connector for flashing.


Requirements for v1.2

* fix known issues of v1.1
* move button closer to the center of the PCB
* strict size constraints are not a prio anymore (width can be increased to 1-2 mm, length as well)
* develop a sufficient set of testpoints for bring-up checks and tests
* provide bottom testpoints for development purposes
* provide top testpoints for power, battery and charging-related tests + JTAG + console
* develop a test fixture with pogo-pins for development

Development testpoints (bottom)
* all JTAG pins
* UART
* power input
* charger output
* LDO en
* 3.3V
* one of DEC caps
* PDM clock and data
* SPI bus
* 1-3 GPIOs

Production testpoints (top)
